BEFORE RUNNING THE PROGRAM, PLEASE INSTALL XAMPP BY FOLLOWING THE LINK BELOW:
https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
THE PROGRAM WILL NOT RUN CORRECTLY UNLESS XAMPP IS DOWNLOADED TO ITS DEFAULT LOCATION IN THE C: DRIVE.

THEN RUN setup.py BEFORE OPENING THE PROGRAM. Once THIS IS COMPLETE, YOU MAY CONTINUE

TO RUN THE PROGRAM:
Open the GUI.py file in the Working Folder

The actual program that my project demonstrates only consists of the three subprograms:
data_collection_model.py
GUI.py
linear_regresion_model.py

...and any other .py files present in this folder were generated by python to increase performance or were used for testing, not for actual program functionality.
As such they are not formatted to be viewed but are only present to show evidence of the testing process.
